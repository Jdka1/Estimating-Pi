# Estimating-Pi
Estimating pi using some simple inferential statistics and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of events.

I led a lecture on Monte Carlo simulations for my Economic Thesis Seminar class, and this was a hands-on exercise I created at the end of the lesson to have students practice Monte Carlo probability estimation on a simple task. Original task was estimating the price of a nonnonstandard put option.
